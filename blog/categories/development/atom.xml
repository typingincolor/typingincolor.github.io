    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/typhoon.jpeg">
One of my colleagues attend QCon London and saw a presentation by <a href="http://www.michaelnygard.com/">Michael Nygard</a>
on <a href="http://gotocon.com/berlin-2013/presentation/Maneuverable%20Web%20Architecture">Maneuverable Web Architecture</a>. A few of us got together and watched it and
it got us thinking…</p>

<p>Businesses need to be able to move quickly, and some of the established architectural
patterns stop them doing this. The presentation contained lots of ideas but I am going
to concentrate on one: sending an email to a customer.</p>

<p>The traditional approach is for the application sending the email to write to a
database saying who the email is to goto, when to send it and the data to be included
in the email. A batch job wakes up, scans the database for emails to send, builds them
and then sends them on.</p>

<p>This approach works well, loads of people have done it, and it is pretty easy to
implement. There are some problems though: changing things can be difficult; you have
to make sure that you don’t break any of the queued emails whenever you make a change.
The solution isn’t very flexible either, it is good for sending emails but if you want
to do something else you will have to revisit your entire solution.</p>

<p>Is there a better way? Michael proposed this approach. When I first saw it I thought
it was a bit crazy, but I had a go at implementing it and it has a lot going for it…</p>

<p>We first create a few components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>at service</strong> - this service calls a specified url at a given point in time</li>
  <li><strong>script engine</strong> - this service is passed a script and executes it</li>
  <li><strong>script factory</strong> - this service builds scripts for the script engine to execute</li>
</ul>

<p>How does this let us send an email to a customer?</p>

<ul>
  <li>the client sending the email says to the script factory: “Give me an email sending script”</li>
  <li>the script factory builds the script and passes a url to execute the script to the client</li>
  <li>the client says to the at service: “Call this url now”</li>
  <li>the at service calls the url, and the script engine executes the script</li>
  <li>the script does everything required to send an email to the customer</li>
</ul>

<p>How is this better?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The at service just calls urls at a point in time, you can use it for anything</li>
  <li>If the you add new functionality you can just deploy a new script engine and script factory
on a different url. All the exisitng scripts will still work, any new scripts will go to the new
versions. If you want to add email tracking, change the script factory to include
it and then all new scripts will have email tracking. All the old scripts will still work.</li>
  <li>All clients are doing is asking for a script and scheduling them. You
can write scripts to do anything you can think of…</li>
</ul>

<p>I am glossing over some of the problems… The script engine is non-trivial, error
handling seems complicated and it takes some explaining to developers.</p>

<p>If your interested I had a go at implementing the approach, you can see the results on <a href="http://github.com/typingincolor/typhoon">github</a>.
It is by no means production ready, but you can kind of see how it could work…</p>

    <link href="http://www.landofshattereddreams.com/blog/2014/03/17/adventures-in-oauth2/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-17T09:01:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.landofshattereddreams.com/blog/2014/03/17/adventures-in-oauth2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/logos/oauth-2-sm.png">
I’ve not been able to blog for a while as a lot of things have been going on.
In November I left <a href="http://www.morrisons.co.uk">Morrisons</a> to take a Solutions Architect role at <a href="http://www.laterooms.com">Laterooms</a>
and it has taken me a while to get settled in and to work out what’s going on.</p>

<p>One of the things I am looking at for Laterooms is how we use APIs to power our
platform. We’ve developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful APIs</a> that are used by our mobile applications
but we can do a whole lot more with our APIs. Long term, I’d like to build our entire
platform on APIs using them as the base for our mobile apps, the websites and our
integration with affiliates and hotel providers. We’ve got a long way to go, but
I guess a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</p>

<p>One of the key considerations we have when designing our API platform is controlling
who has access to our data. We want to build a platform capable of allowing <em>authorized</em>
consumers unlimited access to Lateroom’s data. Note <em>authorized</em> consumers, some data
is public and we want to make it as easy as possible to access it; some data is
most definitely not public and access to it has to be limited.</p>

<p>To help us control access to our APIs I have been looking at various API management
platform and how they implement OAuth2 to provide authorized access to an API. The
three I talk about in this post are from <a href="http://www.apigee.com">Apigee</a>, <a href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a> and <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com">Mulesoft</a>.</p>

<h3 id="oauth2">OAuth2</h3>
<p>Before we start I supose it is worth talking a bit about <a href="http://oauth.net/2/">OAuth2</a>. To quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OAuth is an open standard for authorization. OAuth provides a method for clients
to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner such as a different
client or an end-user. It also provides a process for end-users to authorize
third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials,
typically a username and password pair, using user-agent redirections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The OAuth2 <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">spec</a> is a long and complicated document with many, many options.
To compare the three management platforms I built a simple API hosted on <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.
I also wrote a simple client web app that consumed the API again hosted on Heroku.
Finally I wired in each of the API management platforms to protect the API and
to ensure only authenticated users could use the client.</p>

<p>I used the “Authorization Code” flow to authenticate and authorise the client users,
which means that the client does not need any knowledge of the user’s credentials
and all the authentication and authorization is done on the API side.</p>

<p>At a high level, every API request by the client requires an access token to call a
protected resource. The steps to get an access token are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the user authenticates themselves using a web application hosted on the API side</li>
  <li>the client application is passed an authorization code via a callback method.
The client exchanges this code for an access token, authenticating itself with a
client ID and secret.</li>
  <li>the client attaches the access token to any API calls</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the API management platform achieves this in a slightly different way.</p>

<h3 id="mashery">Mashery</h3>
<p>To implement the flow in Mashery I wrote a simple node app that presented a user
a screen to enter their username and password and which validated them. The user
clicks on a link in the client app and is taken to this validation screen.</p>

<p>If the validation succeeds the web app uses a Mashery API to generate an authorization
code and this is passed back to the client via it’s callback url. The client makes a call
to a “token” endpoint configured in the Mashery API and which responds with an access token.
This token is passed with every subsequent API call and the Mashery platform ensures that
it is valid.</p>

<p>This is the implementation I tried last, and it took me very little effort to
change the code a developed using Apigee to work with Mashery.</p>

<h3 id="apigee">Apigee</h3>
<p>Apigee’s approach is slightly different to Mashery. I had to expose three
endpoints in Apigee. The first endpoint redirects to the login application where
the user enters their details. If the details are correct, the login app calls
the second endpoint which generates an authorization code and passes it to the
client app via its callback url. The client then uses the third endpoint to
exchange the code for an access token.</p>

<p>It took me a while to remember how OAuth works, but once I had that the example
from Apigee was easy to follow and I got things up and running pretty quickly.</p>

<h3 id="mulesoft">Mulesoft</h3>
<p>Mulesoft is a relatively new player in the API management space, primarily being
known for their ESB.The biggest difference between the the solution I built with
this and the others was that Mulesoft provided the login application, with no
ability to develop your own. It is relatively simple to plug this login app
into an existing database, and you do have control over how it looks but it does
mean you have to know about <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/">Spring</a> and Java (both of which I do). Getting
an access token was easy, and wiring in the API was pretty simple. I did like
that you can run everything on a local machine whilst developing - but it also
required the most technical knowledge to get working.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All three platforms made it simple to implement the required functionality.
Mashery and Apigee’s approach are pretty similar (although the platforms are
quite different), and Mulesoft’s approach also work’s well.</p>

    <link href="http://www.landofshattereddreams.com/blog/2013/06/27/documenting-apis/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-27T14:37:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.landofshattereddreams.com/blog/2013/06/27/documenting-apis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the projects I am working on at work is revamping our mobile applications.</p>

<p>We are designing a RESTful web service layer that a mobile device will use to allow a customer to do various things.</p>

<p>One of the problems I have is that a third party is going to build the service layer and they need to be told what services the API layer has to expose. The mobile devs also need to know what to expect from the service.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to document everything using Word documents, but I couldn’t really get to a format that I liked. After talking to a few people I decided to try a couple of tools</p>

<h2 id="apiary">Apiary</h2>
<p><a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a> allows you to define an API using a simple, Markdown inspired DSL.</p>

<pre><code>HOST: http://shop.acme.com/
--- Sample API v2 ---
---
Welcome to our API. Comments support [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax.
---
-- Shopping Cart Resources --
GET /shopping-cart
&gt; Accept: application/json
&lt; 200
&lt; Content-Type: application/json
{ "items": [
    { "url": "/shopping-cart/1", "product":"2ZY48XPZ", "quantity": 1, "name": "New socks", "price": 1.25 }
  ] }
</code></pre>

<p>It turns this markdown into some nice looking documentation to describe your API. It even lets you call the API from within Apiary and it can stub your API for you as well…</p>

<p>I liked it, but I couldn’t put the level of detail in the documentation that I wanted. I’d also prefer to deploy the documentation with the API not on Apiary’s site.</p>

<h2 id="swagger">Swagger</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> have taken a slightly different approach, or actually several approaches. You can document you api in a number of ways: you can write some json to describe it, you can write java/scala and annotate your code or you can do it in javascript. Either way you end up with a load of json that describes your API.</p>

<p>Swagger-ui can be deployed with the API and renders the json in a nice looking format. You can also use it to call the API, but it doesn’t stub it for you.</p>

<p>You can see a demo <a href="http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the end I used swagger, and annotated a Javascript stub that I was writing anyway. I can document everything I need to, and the developers get a nice UI to see what the API does.</p>

    <link href="http://www.landofshattereddreams.com/blog/2013/04/10/playing-with-rest-assured/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-10T11:28:31+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.landofshattereddreams.com/blog/2013/04/10/playing-with-rest-assured</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are moving to a service oriented architecture at work based using technology from <a href="http://apigee.com">Apigee</a> which is helping us build securable and scalable APIs for our applications to use.</p>

<p>Our APIs are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful Web Services</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> message bodies. This is means that they can be used by anything that can send a HTTP request, including a browser.</p>

<p>One of the challenges is testing these APIs. Being a Java shop, sending the HTTP requests can be a bit of a faff, as can parsing the resultant JSON responses. We want the tests to be automated, and seeing as we use <a href="http://junit.org">Junit</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/">Hamcrest</a> something that works in a similar way would be good. After a bit of googling, one of my colleagues pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured">Rest-Assured</a>.</p>

<p>Rest-Assured is a domain specific language for the easy testing of REST services, and attempts to bring the simplicity of using a dynamic language such a Ruby or Groovy to Java. It does this pretty well!</p>

<p>What I particularly like is that you can set up a fairly complex scenario with a minimum of code and it is really easy to see what is being tested. The documentation on the website is really good, but as an example:</p>

<p>Assume that a GET request to http://localhost:8080/ returns JSON as:</p>

<p><code>json
{
    "lotto":{
         "lottoId":5,
         "winning-numbers":[2,45,34,23,7,5,3],
         "winners":[{
               "winnerId":23,
               "numbers":[2,45,34,23,3,5]
         },{
               "winnerId":54,
               "numbers":[52,3,12,11,18,22]
         }]
    }
}
</code></p>

<p>Then:</p>

<p><code>ruby
expect().body("lotto.lottoId", equalTo(5)).when().get("/lotto");
</code></p>

<p>Verifies that the lottoId is 5 when you get it. It’s easy to read, simple to setup, and really powerful…</p>

    <link href="http://www.landofshattereddreams.com/blog/2012/09/22/facebook-london-hackathon-2012/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-22T10:05:34+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.landofshattereddreams.com/blog/2012/09/22/facebook-london-hackathon-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I went to Facebook’s London office for my first “Hackathon”.</p>

<p>We got started around 0930, and had a few hours of talks from the Facebook team as well as a number of their partners. The guys from Facebook talked to us about Open Graph, mobile development and Facebook games. The talks were a good introduction to Facebook’s various apis that we would be using for during the afternoon’s hacking. Three of Facebook’s partners then gave a very quick overview of their services.</p>

<p>We saw presentations from:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, who provide all sorts of telephony goodness</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.deezer.com/en/">Deezer</a>, a web based music platform</li>
  <li><a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>, a way of doing real time magic</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/events/hackathon.jpg" title="hackathon" >
Once we’d finished we moved on the hacking. Everybody split into teams and had 7 hours to build something using the technologies discussed in the morning. Various prizes were on offer for the best hacks, they just had to use the Facebook platform.</p>

<p>Ben and I were at a slight disadvantage in that there were only two of us in our team, and we wanted to build something that we could use a work. We had a few ideas over the previous couple of days and decided to build a store visit application. Basically, a customer goes to app’s Facebook page, chooses which store they visited and are asked to submit a review of the store. The review is posted to Open Graph and will appear on the customer’s Facebook timeline. When a customer visits the page of the store, they will see all the reviews for that store and be able to like, comment etc on them.</p>

<p>We also wanted to use Twilio to contact the customer if their review was negative to try to address whatever problem the customer had.</p>

<p>We’re kind of limited to our technology choice seeing as we do things in Java, so we built our app on Tomcat using Spring MVC. We got to the point of posting the customer’s review to Open Graph, but we didn’t really have anything in a fit state to present to the group.</p>

<p>Most of our problems were around our choice of technology. Spring is a great framework, but it can be a bit of a pain to configure properly. I tried to get hibernate working with hsqldb but failed miserably and spent 90 minutes trying to persist our reviews. In the end I gave up, installed mongodb and got it working in about 20 minutes. I used the <a href="http://progrium.com/localtunnel/">localtunnel</a> gem  to allow Facebook access to my dev machine, but it kept on timing out which meant I had to continually reconfigure the app in Facebook. I used <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a> for the colours and shapes, but it didn’t work properly in the Facebook canvas iframe.</p>

<p>Going forward, I’m going to look at <a href="http://java.heroku.com/">Java Heroku</a> which will remove the need for localtunnel. I need to play with bootstrap to get that to work properly and I will get the persistence layer working before I start when I go to my next hackathon.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a very useful day. I don’t get much chance to code anymore, let alone for 7 hours straight. The facilities provided by Facebook were excellent and all their engineers were very helpful.</p>
