  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the projects I am working on at work is revamping our mobile applications.</p>

<p>We are designing a RESTful web service layer that a mobile device will use to allow a customer to do various things.</p>

<p>One of the problems I have is that a third party is going to build the service layer and they need to be told what services the API layer has to expose. The mobile devs also need to know what to expect from the service.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to document everything using Word documents, but I couldn’t really get to a format that I liked. After talking to a few people I decided to try a couple of tools</p>

<h2 id="apiary">Apiary</h2>
<p><a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a> allows you to define an API using a simple, Markdown inspired DSL. </p>

<pre><code>HOST: http://shop.acme.com/
--- Sample API v2 ---
---
Welcome to our API. Comments support [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax.
---
-- Shopping Cart Resources --
GET /shopping-cart
&gt; Accept: application/json
&lt; 200
&lt; Content-Type: application/json
{ "items": [
    { "url": "/shopping-cart/1", "product":"2ZY48XPZ", "quantity": 1, "name": "New socks", "price": 1.25 }
  ] }
</code></pre>

<p>It turns this markdown into some nice looking documentation to describe your API. It even lets you call the API from within Apiary and it can stub your API for you as well…</p>

<p>I liked it, but I couldn’t put the level of detail in the documentation that I wanted. I’d also prefer to deploy the documentation with the API not on Apiary’s site.</p>

<h2 id="swagger">Swagger</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> have taken a slightly different approach, or actually several approaches. You can document you api in a number of ways: you can write some json to describe it, you can write java/scala and annotate your code or you can do it in javascript. Either way you end up with a load of json that describes your API.</p>

<p>Swagger-ui can be deployed with the API and renders the json in a nice looking format. You can also use it to call the API, but it doesn’t stub it for you.</p>

<p>You can see a demo <a href="http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the end I used swagger, and annotated a Javascript stub that I was writing anyway. I can document everything I need to, and the developers get a nice UI to see what the API does.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For sale one <a href="http://www.brompton.co.uk/">Brompton H6L</a>, hand built in September 2012. One careful owner (me!), selling as commuting on the train doesn’t fit in with work and childcare commitments.</p>

<p>The bike is pretty much as new, and in very good condition. It’s orange, it’s really well made and it’s very small when folded.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/images/brompton/brompton_1.jpg" /></td>
      <td><img src="/images/brompton/brompton_3.jpg" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I had it custom built so there are a few features over the standard build:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it has a Shimano dynamo hub, so lights are always available</li>
  <li>it has Eazy Wheels fitted</li>
  <li>it has the telescopic seat post, I’m 6’4 and I had no trouble riding it</li>
  <li>it has the luggage block, and a Brompton C bag</li>
  <li>it has a cover and saddle bag, so you can take it on the tram</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll consider any sensible offer…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been blogging at as <a href="http://typingincolor.com">typingincolor</a> for about three years. It started as
an exercise to learn a bit about wordpress, and was a place where I reviewed 
whatever DVDs and books I’d been looking at. </p>

<p>As time progressed, I began to add some stuff about work and technology. 
In particular I talked a bit about the journey the company I was working for
was taking into the world of agile development. I also put in some stuff about
technology that I was currently looking at.</p>

<p>It worked (and works) pretty well, but I’ve decided to try something new. I’ve
chosen to use <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> as it will let me use some technologies I’m 
interested in. I particularly like that the styling is done using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a> and
the content written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>. That fact that it’s built on ruby is a 
happy coincidence.</p>

<p>The other thing I do really like is that it uses <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> to publish the content. 
I can run a local copy of any changes I make and preview them locally, I can then
push the content up to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a> where they are visible to the world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are moving to a service oriented architecture at work based using technology from <a href="http://apigee.com">Apigee</a> which is helping us build securable and scalable APIs for our applications to use.</p>

<p>Our APIs are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful Web Services</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> message bodies. This is means that they can be used by anything that can send a HTTP request, including a browser.</p>

<p>One of the challenges is testing these APIs. Being a Java shop, sending the HTTP requests can be a bit of a faff, as can parsing the resultant JSON responses. We want the tests to be automated, and seeing as we use <a href="http://junit.org">Junit</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/">Hamcrest</a> something that works in a similar way would be good. After a bit of googling, one of my colleagues pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured">Rest-Assured</a>.</p>

<p>Rest-Assured is a domain specific language for the easy testing of REST services, and attempts to bring the simplicity of using a dynamic language such a Ruby or Groovy to Java. It does this pretty well!</p>

<p>What I particularly like is that you can set up a fairly complex scenario with a minimum of code and it is really easy to see what is being tested. The documentation on the website is really good, but as an example:</p>

<p>Assume that a GET request to http://localhost:8080/ returns JSON as:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I went to Facebook’s London office for my first “Hackathon”.</p>

<p>We got started around 0930, and had a few hours of talks from the Facebook team as well as a number of their partners. The guys from Facebook talked to us about Open Graph, mobile development and Facebook games. The talks were a good introduction to Facebook’s various apis that we would be using for during the afternoon’s hacking. Three of Facebook’s partners then gave a very quick overview of their services.</p>

<p>We saw presentations from:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, who provide all sorts of telephony goodness</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.deezer.com/en/">Deezer</a>, a web based music platform</li>
  <li><a href="http://pusher.com">Pusher</a>, a way of doing real time magic</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/events/hackathon.jpg" title="hackathon" />
Once we’d finished we moved on the hacking. Everybody split into teams and had 7 hours to build something using the technologies discussed in the morning. Various prizes were on offer for the best hacks, they just had to use the Facebook platform.</p>

<p>Ben and I were at a slight disadvantage in that there were only two of us in our team, and we wanted to build something that we could use a work. We had a few ideas over the previous couple of days and decided to build a store visit application. Basically, a customer goes to app’s Facebook page, chooses which store they visited and are asked to submit a review of the store. The review is posted to Open Graph and will appear on the customer’s Facebook timeline. When a customer visits the page of the store, they will see all the reviews for that store and be able to like, comment etc on them.</p>

<p>We also wanted to use Twilio to contact the customer if their review was negative to try to address whatever problem the customer had.</p>

<p>We’re kind of limited to our technology choice seeing as we do things in Java, so we built our app on Tomcat using Spring MVC. We got to the point of posting the customer’s review to Open Graph, but we didn’t really have anything in a fit state to present to the group.</p>

<p>Most of our problems were around our choice of technology. Spring is a great framework, but it can be a bit of a pain to configure properly. I tried to get hibernate working with hsqldb but failed miserably and spent 90 minutes trying to persist our reviews. In the end I gave up, installed mongodb and got it working in about 20 minutes. I used the <a href="http://progrium.com/localtunnel/">localtunnel</a> gem  to allow Facebook access to my dev machine, but it kept on timing out which meant I had to continually reconfigure the app in Facebook. I used <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a> for the colours and shapes, but it didn’t work properly in the Facebook canvas iframe.</p>

<p>Going forward, I’m going to look at <a href="http://java.heroku.com/">Java Heroku</a> which will remove the need for localtunnel. I need to play with bootstrap to get that to work properly and I will get the persistence layer working before I start when I go to my next hackathon.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a very useful day. I don’t get much chance to code anymore, let alone for 7 hours straight. The facilities provided by Facebook were excellent and all their engineers were very helpful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I left my job at the Hut Group after 3.5 years and decided to move on to Morrisons to help them develop their online offering. The first thing I did on joining them was look at Open Graph in Facebook for a project they are working on.</p>

<p>Open Graph allows you to specify an action and an object, and do the action to the object. It will put the fact you’ve done this on you Facebook timeline for all your friends to see. On the AutoTrader website for example, you can “want” a car. The demo app from Facebook shows you how to “cook” a recipe. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>I found the whole thing really interesting. I got to write some javascript which I’ve not really done much of, and figuring out how to stop a user doing the same action twice was quite challenging. </p>

<p>Testing my app was a bit of a faff, as I was running on a corporate network and you need to allow Facebook access to your website. I managed to get around it by setting up a reverse ssh tunnel to an Amazon EC2 instance and forwarding the web requests from there to my application. It took me a while to get working, but it is actually dead simple once you know what you are doing. </p>

<p>The Facebook documentation is quite good, and the tutorial is really easy to follow. I got two relatively complicated apps going in about three days and I’m not great a javascript…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am looking at ways that I can build a web front-end for a system I am going to develop at work. Basically, I want to have a number of web services that will provide the data and then write a front end in html and java script to consume these services and display the data to a user.</p>

<p>I’m not a javascript expert, can do a bit of html and really didn’t want to do use java as it isn’t the quickest thing develop a prototype.</p>

<p>In the end I chose <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort. It is stupidly easy to create a web application! For example:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="line"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;sinatra&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/hi&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="s2">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Will return “Hello World!” when you go to http://localhost:4567/hi. I used the ROXML gem to squirt out an xml representation of a ruby object and I had a web service in around 30 lines of ruby.</p>

<p>So I had my web service up and running. Now to consume it… As I’ve mentioned before, I like <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a> as it is really easy to write a good looking interface without having to know loads of CSS. HTML is ok, but it can look a bit of a mess, so I decided to use <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a>. It gets transformed into html, but it makes your markup look beautiful. Using it you have to go out of your way to write nasty html. Indentation is significant (a la python) so you have to right it neatly!</p>

<p>The final piece of the jigsaw is <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeescript</a>, a little language that compile into javascript. The aim of coffeescript is to expose the good bits of javascript in a simple way. I like it because it removes the need for endless curly brackets and the function keyword.</p>

<p>All in all, I’m pretty pleased with the results. None of it is earth shattering, but the progress bars are pretty neat and I like the way I’ve built the results table.</p>

<p>If you want to see the code, you can clone it using git </p>

<p>A couple of years ago, one of our technical architects at the Hut Group ran a few code dojos to give the team experience of TDD and Pair Programming. The team has grown massively in the meantime, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to try it again.</p>

<p>To quote from <a href="http://codingdojo.org/">codingdojo.org</a>, a dojo is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there to have fun and to engage in <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DeliberatePractice">DeliberatePractice</a> in order to improve their skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I booked the boardroom, setup an Intellij project on my MacBook and waited for the developers to arrive. In the end about 10 people came, with a range of development experience from less than a year, to more than we’d care to admit to.</p>

<p>The exercise I chose for the group was to implement the “fizz buzz” game. Basically for a given natural number greater zero return</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“fizz” if the number is divisible by 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“buzz” if the number is divisible by 5</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“fizzbuzz” if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>otherwise return the number</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first comedy moment was when we went round the table and tried to play “fizz buzz”. You’d have thought a group of highly skilled IT professionals would be able to do simple mental arithmetic, but this is apparently not the case…</p>

<p>The problem itself isn’t all that complicated, a decent developer could write the code in 5 minutes, but the point of the exercise isn’t really the end solution. More important is how you get to it. A pair of developers worked at the laptop. The driver types, focuses on tactics and writing clean code that compiles and runs. The navigator focuses on strategy. How the code fits into the overall design, which tests will drive the code forward, and which refactorings will improve the entire codebase.</p>

<p>We also wanted to build the solution using Test Driven Development. You write a test that fails, write some code to make it pass and then refactor. With a problem this simple it is quite difficult to force yourself to follow these steps.</p>

<p>We started with the simplest case we could think of, i.e. if you pass in 1, you get 1 back and built from there. We managed 7 iterations in the time we had available and got to a reasonable solution.</p>

<p>Going through the exercise prompted a lot of interesting debate. We talked about how you identify test cases, different ways of implementing the algorithm and even got into some OO design. I think the group found the exercise useful, I guess the proof will be when I see how many people come to the second code dojo.</p>

<p>There was one thing that I didn’t think worked too well. The navigator didn’t really get to contribute as the entire group chipped in ideas so effectively we had 10 navigators, but I’m not sure if this wasn’t a good thing.</p>

<p>Next time I may try using <a href="http://www.cyber-dojo.com/">cyber-dojo</a> which would allow pairs to work at the same time. It is a pretty neat site where you select a exercise and can code it online in a huge number of languages. One thing it does prove is that Java is a bit of a nightmare without an IDE, Ruby is the future!</p>

As discussed earlier I have been playing with bootstrap for a few weeks and I’m beginning to get into in now. Below is an example of a screen I re-developed to replace a horrible accordion control with tabs and pagination from bootstrap.</p>

<p>I think it looks much better now and it was pretty simple to implement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m not a big fan of developing user interfaces. Back in the day I used a tool called OpenROAD to write GUIs for database applications. It was a bit like VB, in that it was an event driven 4GL, but it stored everything in an Ingres database. You couldn’t do proper version control. There was no separation of business logic from presentation logic and you used on grids to position everything. I got quite good at it, but it put me off GUIs for ever.</p>

<p>Moving forward to the present day. I work for one of the UK’s largest online retailers and not liking GUIs is a bit of a disadvantage. I can knock up a webpage pretty quickly and can even do css to a degree, but I’m far from great and not in the same league as our front-end dev team.</p>

<p>I’ve been listening in on a few conversations and Bootstrap from Twitter came up. Bootstrap aims to provide Simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions. I have to admit it seems to do it pretty darn well. I’ve been having a play with it this evening and have managed to knock up a couple of decent (in my opinion) looking screens pretty easily. I’ve got a functional nav-bar, some drop down menus and a reasonable looking form. All the javascript you need comes with it, the css is easy to apply to the html and there are some nice looking icons with it as well. All in all it’s been a pretty painless experience.</p>

<p>It might be time to buy some flip-flops, get a couple of shirts from Threadless and see if I can join the design team… (although my complete lack of talent will probably count against me).</p>

<p>If you interested, Bootstrap can be found <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">here</a>.</p>
