    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a developer of long experience, and a manager more recently this joke appealed to me:</p>

<p>A tourist walked into a pet shop and was looking at the animals on display. While he was there,another customer walked in and said to the shopkeeper, “I’ll have a C monkey please.” The shopkeeper nodded, went over to a cage at the side of the shop and took out a monkey. He fitted a collar and leash, handed to the customer,saying, “That’ll be $5,000.”</p>

<p>The customer paid and walked out with his monkey. Startled,the tourist went over to the shopkeeper and said,”That was a very expensive monkey. Most of them are only a few hundred pounds. Why did it cost so much? “The shopkeeper answered, “Ah,that monkey can program in C - very fast,tight code,no bugs,well worth the money.”</p>

<p>The tourist looked at a monkey in another cage. “Hey,that one’s even more expensive! $10,000! What does it do?”</p>

<p>“Oh,that one’s a C++ monkey; it can manage object-oriented programming,Visual C++, even some Java All the really useful stuff,” said the shopkeeper.</p>

<p>The tourist looked around for a little longer and saw a third monkey in a cage of its own. The price tag around its neck read $50,000.The tourist gasped to the shopkeeper, “That one costs more than all the others put together! What on earth does it do?”</p>

<p>The shopkeeper replied, “Well, I haven’t actually seen it do anything, but it says it’s a project manager”.</p>
